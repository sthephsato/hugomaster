* So far there are NO confirmed Corona Virus cases in Peru
* Sensibilization campaigns are being provided at travel hubs
* The government has taken additional steps in case there would be an outbreak
* The general health recommendations with regards to the Corona Virus are being taken seriously

With the Corona Virus being detected in more than 15 countries worldwide and the confirmation of the first case in South America, it is possible that the Virus will also spread to Peru. A Brazilian citizen who recently was on vacation in Italy is confirmed to have tested positive for the CoronaVirus (COVID-19) two days ago and with this South America has been put on alert. 

So far there have not been any confirmed CoronaVirus cases in Peru but there have been two suspected cases with foreigners in Lima and one in Cusco. All three cases involved visitors to Peru who recently arrived from China. Another 33 cases were dismissed among local people. In most cases, people were diagnosed with regular flu and other minor illnesses. 

The Peruvian government has taken steps to be able to detect and contain any potential first case but with travelers all over the world coming to Machu Picchu, there are some areas where more precaution is necessary. Face masks have been a regular sight with Asian visitors in Lima in recent years but for a few days, the first visitors with face masks in Cusco and Machu Picchu also appeared. This may be a little overly precautionary with no official cases registered in Peru but it paints a picture of the fear worldwide for a pandemic. 

All government hospitals in Peru have to provide a free diagnosis to all people who suspect to have contracted the virus and areas with a higher international confluence such as airports and train stations, have been provided with sensibilization campaigns informing travelers of the symptoms and what to do in case one suspects to have contracted the CoronaVirus. In Lima the government has equipped three hospitals in case there would be an outbreak and more hospitals are being equipped in other parts of the country. 

The Peruvian population, in general, is taking the health recommendations and precautions seriously but maintains a healthy attitude to the situation without exaggerations or unnecessary hysteria. So far no additional travel restrictions for people coming to Peru or traveling from Peru have been put in place and the situation is constantly being monitored. 

As individual travelers, we can also contribute and make sure to apply additional hygiene, especially when traveling and passing through larger passenger hubs. Following some general recommendations;  

* Wash your hands frequently
* Maintain social distancing
* Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
* Practice respiratory hygiene
* If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early
