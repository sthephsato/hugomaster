* **Machu Picchu Mountain is the best alternative for those we cannot hike Huayna Picchu**
* **Machu Picchu Mountain is located on the South side of Machu Picchu**
* **The top is located at a breathtaking 10,120ft (3,085m) above sea level**
* **The hike takes about 2 hours up and 1 hour to come back down**
* **The hike is best done on the start of your Machu Picchu visit due to its location**

In recent years Huayna Picchu Mountain has gained a lot of attraction and has become so popular that the amount of visitors had to be limited in order to protect this part of Machu Picchu. The number set up was **400 people daily** and this is probably only half of the number of people interested in visiting this mountain daily. As numbers could not be increased they started thinking on alternative hikes that would also provide you with a birds-eye view of Machu Picchu and visitors an interesting hike. This alternative was found in Machu Picchu Mountain. Machu Picchu Mountain is the peak that is located opposite from Huayna Picchu on the Southern side of the site. Machu Picchu Mountain is actually a lot higher than Huayna Picchu and when you reach the top at 10,120ft (3,085m) above sea level it is not only the view that will take your breath away.

The hike itself is obviously longer than the Huayna Picchu one but in general is easier as the paths are wider and much less steep than the Huayna Picchu one making it better for those with fear of altitudes or vertigo. The start of the Machu Picchu Mountain Hike is located taking a left after entering Machu Picchu, towards the Sun Gate. Tickets for Machu Picchu Mountain (also called Monta√±a) are also limited to 400 daily, divided over **two time slots; 7.00am and 9.00am. For these time slots there are three entrance times 6.00am, 7.00am and 8.00am.** The hike to Machu Picchu Mountain takes about 1.5-2.5 hours up and about half coming back down. In order to make your Machu Picchu visit logistically as sound as possible it is best to enter Machu Picchu, visit the Guardsman House (this is the spot for the famous Machu Picchu picture) and from here head to Machu Picchu Mountain for the hike. After completing the hike you can then finish the mandatory walking circuit for Machu Picchu. The costs for the **Machu Picchu and Machu Picchu Mountain ticket for adults is 200 Soles (approx. US$62).**
