* **Best time to visit Machu Picchu is in the dry season**
* **June, July and August busiest months**
* **March and November, transition months**
* **Best time of the year; April, May, September and October**

Machu Picchu can without issues be visited all year round and open 365 days in the year. This being said, being an outdoors location, Machu Picchu is subject to the local weather conditions. As you will read almost anywhere; the best time of the year to visit Machu Picchu is the dry season. The dry season, however, runs from March through November roughly, quite a large period of time. Within these months, June, July, and August are by far the most popular as they coincide with the vacation months for North America and Europe and winter holidays in South America. Therefore these months have great weather but quite some crowds to deal with. The months at the beginning and end of this period, namely March and November are good months but as these are transition months, some rain must be kept in consideration. Therefore if you would like to make use of the lowest possible crowds and best weather at Machu Picchu, the ideal times to travel are; April and May or September & October.
