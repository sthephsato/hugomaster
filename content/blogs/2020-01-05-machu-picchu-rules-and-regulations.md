## Rules of entrance

When visiting unique sites, that are part of the legacy of humankind, it is logical that these places have to be protected in order for man to be able to enjoy this legacy in centuries to come. The same goes for Machu Picchu which by its unique location and structure is not necessarily designed to manage the amount of people that visit this amazing Lost City daily. In order to diminish the potential damage done by the visitors to Machu Picchu several rules have been put in place. It is mandatory for the visitors to respect these rules and any other indication the guards may give them during their visit. Refusal to respect these rules can lead to removal from the site or even juridic persecution in extreme cases.
