Today the President Martin Vizcara during his daily briefing, announced the extension of the mandatory lock down and curfew till April 12, 2020 or another 13 days after the original March 30 date set some time back. As this will complicate the financial situation of many of the most vulnerable people in Peru, the government also announced a special bonus for the poorest residents of 380 Soles and a bonus of 35% for those who earn less than 1,500 Soles monthly. On top of this workers with a CTS account (money that is part of the wages but stored for when you leave the job) can take up to 2,400 Soles from this account.

Furthermore it must be noted that the measures taken are finally being followed and the number of arrests has come down over the last couple of days. Mostly in North Peru and Lima, where the temperatures are still very hot there are issues with people not respecting the measures. The government has announced heavy fines and even prison time for those violating these COVID-19 state of emergency measures.

Military and police have been deployed and reserve troops have been asked to stand by to make sure that order is maintained in the streets. All international and inter-provincial transportation has still been halted and only the essential industries can partially operate.

So far there have not been any shortages and supermarkets, markets and pharmacies are stocked as normally. The feared increase in prices for daily products has not taken place as was expected - so far all prices, except for some luxury items have been maintained.

Finally it has to be mentioned that at this point all the Easter Celebrations in Peru have been canceled. Especially the ones in Cusco and Ayacucho will be missed as these enjoy worldwide fame.
