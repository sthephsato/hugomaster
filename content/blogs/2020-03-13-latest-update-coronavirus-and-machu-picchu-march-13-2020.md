Friday the 13th, that is the day that the first case of Coronavirus in Cusco was confirmed. Peru now registered 28 confirmed cases of the COV-19 virus, the first patient diagnosed a week ago. In the course of this week the government has taken the following measures;

* Closed all schools, institutes and universities till March 31, 2020
* Cancelled all flights coming from Europe and Asia till April 16, 2020
* Implemented medical check points at Lima airport
* Forbidden all events and gatherings with more than 300 people

At this time further measures are being considered and these could involve canceling flights from the USA, closing tourist and other attractions and limiting internal movement of people and or goods.

People in Peru have started to stock up on food, water and other products but shortages are not likely in the coming time. Many tourists to Peru have cancelled or postponed their trip, not only because of not getting here but also out of fear not to be able to travel back home after their trip. Nevertheless at this time all tourist and other destinations remain open and completely accessible.
