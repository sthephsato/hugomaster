* **Machu Picchu tickets for 2020 will be on sale from January 2, 2020 onward**
* **Prices will remain the same as in 2019**
* **Tickets are sold with fixed entrance times, allowing four hours on site**
* **Visitors have to follow the mandatory circuits and routes that have been put in place**
* **Even though stated in the regulations, a guide for first time visits is not yet obligatory for 2020**

As every year there are some new rules and regulations that are being put in place to protect Machu Picchu from the growing number of visitors. For 2020 this is not the case but they have announced to start implementing the new rules from 2019 more strictly than it was the case uptill now. Quickly recapping, these regulations are; 1) specific entrance times for each ticket; 2) mandatory circuits visitors have to follow and 3) the obligation to use a guide for a first time visit.

### **Fixed Entrance Times**

**Machu Picchu opens at 6.00am and closes at 5.30pm**, 365 days of the year. Visits outside these times are impossible (unless your name is Mick Jagger). From 2019 onward the opening times have been divided into 4 hour windows starting each hour from 6.00am till 2.00pm. So those entering at 6.00am can stay at the site till 10.00am and so on. The entrance times that the ticket is bought for has to be respected and you will be allowed to enter with your ticket till 1 hour after the time stated on the ticket. The exit times however are not being checked so you can stay longer than the 4 hour window if wanted. For those hiking Huayna Picchu or Machu Picchu Mountain the times allowed are 6 hours and re-entrance (for the bathroom) is allowed. For both these climbs the times remain the same and there are three entrance times; 6.00am, 7.00am and 8.00am to enter the site. Keep in mind that the Machu Picchu Mountain hike is located on the beginning of the site and Huayna Picchu more or less halfway. Why this is important has to do with the mandatory tour circuits that have to be followed.

### **Mandatory Tour Circuits**

Also implemented in 2019 are the mandatory tour circuits or routes that visitors have to follow and cannot divert from. There are three routes that have been put in place. The first Circuit 1 will lead from the entrance up to the Guardsman House and from here tours the rest of the site. The second one, Circuit 2 does not cover the climbing part at the beginning and is therefore more adequate for people who prefer not to do the climb. At the Intihuatana Stone the path meets up with Circuit 1. Circuit 3 leads only over the lower part around the main plaza of Machu Picchu and is the shortest route. This one also meets with circuit 1 and 2 at the Intihuatana Stone. Keep in mind that all of these circuits cannot be backtracked so once you pass a certain point you cannot return. All circuits on the end will automatically lead to the exit of the site. Once passed this point you will not be allowed in anymore (unless you have a Huayna or Machu Picchu Mountain Ticket). Apart from the mandatory circuits, Machu Picchu also has some additional places one can visit. All of these are located on Circuit 1 and can only be accessed when you get to this point - you cannot return for these. When following circuit 1, from the entrance you will encounter these in the following order; hike to the Sun Gate (all tickets), hike to Machu Picchu Mountain (only 400 people daily with this ticket), the Inca bridge (all tickets), Intihuatana (all tickets but only open till 10.00am); Huayna Picchu (only 400 people daily with this ticket) and the Lower Terraces.

### **Mandatory Guides for first time visits**

Another new rule that was added last year has to do with the protection of the site. In order to protect the site one of the new rules is that first time visitors (in the 12 month period) have to be accompanied by an official tour guide. This way the tour guide can explain what you can and what you cannot do to the first time visitor. At this point it is accepted that this rule will not be implemented for the moment and visitors can still enter Machu Picchu without being accompanied by a tour guide. In case this would change we will let you know of course.
