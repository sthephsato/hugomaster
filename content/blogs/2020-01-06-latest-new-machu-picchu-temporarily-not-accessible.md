TRAIN SERVICES TO MACHU PICCHU HAVE RESUMED

{{< insertcontent url="/blogs/2020-01-06-latest-update-train-services-to-machu-picchu-reinstated/" text="TRAIN SERVICES TO MACHU PICCHU HAVE RESUMED" >}}


* **Machu Picchu temporarily not accessible by train**
* **Not clear how hikes to Machu Picchu will be affected**
* **Measure because of increased water level of Vilcanota River**
* **Start of the rainy season- measure in place till water levels decrease**

**Cusco; January 5, 2020 - The Ferrocarril Transandino S.A., the company that operates the train tracks between Cusco and Machu Picchu (Aguas Calientes) has released a statement today informing all passengers that from today 1.00pm till further notice NO TRAINS WITH PASSENGERS ARE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO MACHU PICCHU.**

This measure is due to the the increased water level of the Vicanote River (also called Urubamba River). With this the company hopes to avoid major issues with the train tracks between Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu (Aguas Calientes) which run next to the Vilcanote River.

The measure states that there are no trains with passengers allowed on the tracks between Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu only between Machu Picchu and Ollantaytambo to evacuate the people that are already in Machu Picchu. As most visitors to Machu Picchu travel there and back by train this affects the largest part of visitors to Machu Picchu.

The other part, the people that hike there will most likely also be affected. Those already on the 4 day Inca Trail will be able to finish the trail and return by train as will those doing the Salkantay Hike. Groups that still have to depart will have to wait for what the train companies decide in the coming days. The 2 day Inca Trail is not accessible as the trains cannot take passengers there.

It is hard to foresee how long this situation can last. The measure fully depends on the water level of the river. If this would come down the measure will be lifted. If this would not be the case, Machu Picchu may not be accessible for some time more. For people traveling in the coming days it is recommended to get in touch with your agency or travel organization to see if they can postpone your visit or provide you with a (partial) refund. For individual travelers you will have to claim this with the ticket office and train company directly.

Please keep in mind that at this time there is little information available. January is the start of the rainy season so it is hard to foresee how this situation will evolve. We will keep a close eye on the situation and post any updates on this page.
