Generally speaking, Machu Picchu weather is relatively warm during the daytime and tends to cool off at night. Temperatures throughout the year range between 55 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (12 and 27 degrees Celsius). More so than temperature, weather at Machu Picchu is distinguished more by its humidity. The region only knows two seasons, a rainy and a dry season but humidity can be high throughout the year.  The sub-tropical forests surrounding the Machu Picchu area, due to its ecosystem, can in some years see close to 77 inches (1,955 mm) of precipitation. While the greatest amount of rainfall occurs between November and March during the rainy season, rain can also occur during the dry season from April to October.

## Rainy Season at Machu Picchu

The rainy season runs from November to March and is characterized by higher chances of rain. This does not mean it will rain all day or every day but intense showers are possible. In most cases, these are of short duration after which the sun will come through again. It has to be noted that weather changes rapidly in this period and one has to be prepared for a little of everything. Average temperatures are up this time of the year as this is the summer period with maximums of 80°F (27°C) and minimums of 55°F (12°C). As the clouds can hang lower this time of the year, Machu Picchu at times can be shrugged in mist which makes it all the more mysterious but also increases humidity as you are literally standing in the clouds. This can make paths and stairs somewhat more slippery so some additional caution is recommended. The rainy season is the season with lower visitor numbers and therefore have a lot to offer. Not only do crowds and prices go down, but services also become friendlier, the surroundings become greener and lusher and the evenings enjoy gentle temperatures. 

## Dry Season at Machu Picchu

The dry season starts around April and continues till October. The season is characterized by plenty of suns and clear skies, especially in the peak season, June through August and therefore for most people the preferred time to visit Machu Picchu. Rain is still possible, especially at the start and end of the season but it does not last long. Due to the clear skies, day temperatures can be as high as 80°F (27°C) but nights can get as cold as 40°F (5°C).The dry season is the most popular season for Machu Picchu as skies are clear and precipitation limited.
