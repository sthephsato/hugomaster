* **Train services to Machu Picchu have been reinstated according the normal schedule**
* **All visitors can complete their Machu Picchu visit as planned**
* **Water levels of the Vilcanota River have returned to normal levels**
* **The train companies remain vigilant of the situation**
* **January and February are the months with most rain in the Machu Picchu region**

January 6, 2020 This morning Ferrocarril Transandino S.A, the company that runs the train tracks to Machu Picchu, informed the train companies Peru Rail and Inca Rail they can resume train services to and from Machu Picchu according to the normal schedule and frequencies. The levels of the Vilcanota River have returned to their acceptable level for the time of the year and the train tracks have been reopened.

The measure was taken as a precaution in order to avoid damage to the train tracks but it seems that last night water levels came down rapidly and all services can be operated as normally. Several trains to Machu Picchu were cancelled yesterday, January 5 and there was fear that these issues would persist for some time. Luckily now the situation is back to normal and all visitors can complete their visit as planned.

We will keep monitoring the situation and keep our ear to the ground in case any changes would occur to the current situation.
