Some tips for Machu Picchu; officially one cannot take food into Machu Picchu. Small sandwiches for an improvised picnic on the guardsman house area are tolerated. Make sure that your walking stick has a rubber protection for the tip, if not this will not be allowed. Umbrellas are often not tolerated. There are no bathrooms on the site; only at the entrance. Only the tickets with Huayna Picchu or Monta√±a allow for a re-entrance to use the bathrooms. Re-entering the site is complicated with the mandatory circuits.
