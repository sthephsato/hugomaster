Inca Rail used to be quite some cheaper than Peru Rail but nowadays the difference is only felt in the deluxe version of the train; the First Class Train. The starting level, **Voyager you can book for US$59 to US$72 one way** and the Superior **360° Train from US$77 to US$86 one way**. The difference with similar levels with Peru Rail is only a couple of Dollars. The **First Class Train goes at US$200 one way**. All trains include beverages and snacks and the 360° and First Class Train include a meal and have access to an observatory wagon.
