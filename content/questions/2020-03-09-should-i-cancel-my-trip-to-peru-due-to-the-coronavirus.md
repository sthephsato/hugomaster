At this time it is still a little preliminary to cancel your trip to Peru in the nearby future if your country does not apply any travel restrictions. Peru has 6 confirmed cases, all of which seem to have been contained quickly. A lot of rumours and talk is going round but most of these are false and Machu Picchu as well as all other attractions and points of interest are functioning as normally. At this time no travel restrictions to or from Peru have been put in place.
