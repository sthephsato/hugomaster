Every year in February, the month with most rain at Machu Picchu the INC, the governing body that manages Machu Picchu closes the Inca Trail for maintenance. This applies to both versions of the Inca Trail, the short 2 day as the classic 4 day Inca trail to Machu Picchu from February first till March first when the first groups are allowed again. The maintenance involves cleaning up the camping spots, the restrooms, and doing repairs to this ancient trail where necessary.  {{< insertcontent url="/blogs/2019-12-30-hiking-to-machu-picchu/" text="More details on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu" >}}
