As every year the official government website (https://www.machupicchu.gob.pe/inicio) is running behind on the sale of Machu Picchu tickets for 2020. At this time (December 2019) the only tickets available online are till January 5, 2020. All other Machu Picchu tickets for 2020 will not be available online till January 2. It seems prices will remain the same as in 2019.
