December in general is a great month to come to Peru as the festivities this time of the year make traveling in December a little bit more colorful. Weather-wise December is the start of the rainy season in Peru but this does not mean that it rains every day or all day. In general the rain is not that prevalent in December yet and  temperatures are on the rise as this is also the start of the summer. December is popular but not as much as the high season months (June through August) so this also allows for a more tranquil visit.
