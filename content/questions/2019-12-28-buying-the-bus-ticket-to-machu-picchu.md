Bus tickets to Machu Picchu can be purchased online (http://consettur.com/reservas/) or at the Consettur offices in Cusco or Aguas Calientes. The ones in Aguas Calientes are located just around the corner from the bus stop and prices are the same whether you purchase online or in person. For foreign visitors the price is US$24 for the return ticket.
