Yes; upon entering Machu Picchu you will be asked for official proof of identification. This can be with a local ID card for Peruvians and the surrounding countries but for foreigners this will always be with the international passport. Keep in mind that all tickets have to be purchased with a passport number and this has to match the one provided upon entering. If you would change passports between the time you purchase the ticket and the time of travel, you must inform the INC of this change; preferably with at copy of the old and the new passport.
