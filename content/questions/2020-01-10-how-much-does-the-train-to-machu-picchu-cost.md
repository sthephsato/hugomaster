Peru Rail has three train types to Machu Picchu. The **Expedition Train costs between US$54 and US$ 68 one way** and the **Vistadome between US$77 to US$95 one way**. Prices fluctuate depending on the departure times and train stations. The upgrade to the **Hiram Bingham is a little steep at US$495 one way** but you get a luxury train, meals and drinks in return.
