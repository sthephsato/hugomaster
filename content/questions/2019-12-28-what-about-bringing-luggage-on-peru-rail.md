Peru Rail as well as the other train company Inca Rail more or less manage the same luggage limitations. Officially this is for 5kg (12lbs) per person in a small hand luggage kind of bag. This is not imposed too strictly but as storage space on the trains is limited it is best to try to respect the norm as much as possible.
