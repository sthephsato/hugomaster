Between these two optional mountains one can climb when in Machu Picchu, it is obvious that Huayna Picchu is the most important one and since the number of visitors have been limited almost became a separate bucket list destination next to Machu Picchu itself. The main reason, apart from the obvious spectacular views is the fact that on top of this mountain the temple of the Moon can be found as well as some “impossible” terraces.  Machu Picchu Mountain nevertheless provides equally (or according some even more spectacular) views and takes you a lot higher.
