It is true that Machu Picchu has a lot of secrets and that some things we will never understand completely but this is as far as the mystery would go. Machu Picchu has been searched and scanned from top to bottom and back and scientists are pretty certain there will not be any new secret locations appear unless they would be hidden in the large rocks. The escape route you may have heard about probably refer to a path that runs next to Huayna Picchu Mountain but this runs into a dead end. The other three places where entrance or exits were foreseen are the Sun Gate, the place where you can find the entrance nowadays and the Inca Bridge on the West side of the site.It is true that Machu Picchu has a lot of secrets and that some things we will never understand completely but this is as far as the mystery would go.
