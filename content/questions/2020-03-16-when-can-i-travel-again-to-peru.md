Now that the state of emergency has been declared in Peru for the next 15 days, the government has officially closed all borders (sea, land and air) for all traffic and no-one is allowed to enter or leave the country till March 30, 2020. As the COVID-19 crisis is still in full development in South America, it is likely that these restrictions can be in place for a longer period of time.
