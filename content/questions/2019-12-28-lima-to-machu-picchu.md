Most people coming from abroad visiting Machu Picchu have to arrive to Lima first. Lima is Peruâ€™s capital and the main international airport. Peru is a large country so from Lima one has to travel to Cusco (1.5hrs flying or 24hrs bussing) and from here set course for Machu Picchu. From Cusco it is another 100km which can be done with a combination of cars and trains. To travel from Lima to Machu Picchu one should foresee a full day of traveling.
