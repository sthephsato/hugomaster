The whole site of Machu Picchu has cell phone coverage as well as mobile internet most of the time. The mobile internet can be affected at times due to the location and weather conditions but in general is available. Internet
speed may not always be very good. The Inca Trail only has cell phone coverage on certain points and very little mobile internet access till the last day when you get closer to Machu Picchu. On the train to Machu Picchu there is one part where there is no internet or phone coverage.
