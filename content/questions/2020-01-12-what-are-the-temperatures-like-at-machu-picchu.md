Machu Picchu weather most of the time is pleasantly warm during the day. Night times do not get really cold either except for some nights in July and August.  Temperatures in Machu Picchu and Aguas Calientes range between 50 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (12 and 24 degrees Celsius). More so than temperature, weather at Machu Picchu is distinguished more by its dry season and wet season. Humidity levels are always high making sensational temperature often higher than the real ones.
