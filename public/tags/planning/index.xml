      <description>Even though a trip to Peru and Machu Picchu can these days easily be planned for yourself using the internet, many people still book a complete vacation package when visiting Peru and/or Machu Picchu; why? Well the main reason is time; for those with limited time for this trip booking with a travel agency may be the way to go as this will allow you to maximize your time at each destination and rely on the inside knowledge of the agency to make the itinerary as efficient as possible taking into consideration the climate, altitude and other factors.</description>
