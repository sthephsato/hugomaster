      <description>I am glad to inform that for Machu Picchu the altitude is not an issue for most people. As Machu Picchu is located almost 3,500ft lower than Cusco on an altitude of 7,900ft, well under the 10,000ft level on which most people start feeling the altitude. With an altitude of about 7,900ft it is unlikely that the altitude will be an issue during your Machu Picchu visit. For the4 day Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu the altitude is a factor to take into consideration as you will be coming over passes will over 13,000ft.</description>
