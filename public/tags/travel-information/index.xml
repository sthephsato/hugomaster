      <description>Machu Picchu Visitor Tips Machu Picchu is a unique and adventurous destination but is perhaps not as easy to get to as some of the other bucket list destinations that often get listed. For the Colosseum you fly to Rome and the rest is all pretty straight forward. For Christ the Redeemer you fly to Rio and can even take a taxi there. For Machu Picchu this is not that simple making that one would need at least two (preferably more) days in Peru to see Machu Picchu.</description>

      <guid>https://www.guidetomachupicchu.com/questions/2019-12-29-should-i-get-a-guide/</guid>
      <description>Good Question; Officially; Yes you need a guide for a first time Machu Picchu visit. Unofficially; the rule is in place but is not applied and does not seem to be applied in the near future. Secondly, deciding on a guide or not is also something that depends from person to person. Some people enjoy their visit more and some less with a guide so this is very personally. As all Machu Picchu visits are now limited to a fixed route all visits will have more or less the same order and therefore a guide perhaps less necessary.</description>

      <description>Yes; upon entering Machu Picchu you will be asked for official proof of identification. This can be with a local ID card for Peruvians and the surrounding countries but for foreigners this will always be with the international passport. Keep in mind that all tickets have to be purchased with a passport number and this has to match the one provided upon entering. If you would change passports between the time you purchase the ticket and the time of travel, you must inform the INC of this change; preferably with at copy of the old and the new passport.</description>

      <description>At Machu Picchu itself there are two options to eat something but both of these are located just outside the entrance of the site. The first is the Tinkuy Buffet Restaurant located next to the Sanctuary Lodge Hotel and the second is a small snack bar located on the right hand side of the entrance. Both are relatively pricey and officially it is forbidden to take food into the site itself.</description>

      <description>It is true that Machu Picchu has a lot of secrets and that some things we will never understand completely but this is as far as the mystery would go. Machu Picchu has been searched and scanned from top to bottom and back and scientists are pretty certain there will not be any new secret locations appear unless they would be hidden in the large rocks. The escape route you may have heard about probably refer to a path that runs next to Huayna Picchu Mountain but this runs into a dead end.</description>
