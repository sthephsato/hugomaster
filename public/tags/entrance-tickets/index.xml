      <description>Machu Picchu Visitor Tips Machu Picchu is a unique and adventurous destination but is perhaps not as easy to get to as some of the other bucket list destinations that often get listed. For the Colosseum you fly to Rome and the rest is all pretty straight forward. For Christ the Redeemer you fly to Rio and can even take a taxi there. For Machu Picchu this is not that simple making that one would need at least two (preferably more) days in Peru to see Machu Picchu.</description>

      <description>Yes; upon entering Machu Picchu you will be asked for official proof of identification. This can be with a local ID card for Peruvians and the surrounding countries but for foreigners this will always be with the international passport. Keep in mind that all tickets have to be purchased with a passport number and this has to match the one provided upon entering. If you would change passports between the time you purchase the ticket and the time of travel, you must inform the INC of this change; preferably with at copy of the old and the new passport.</description>
