      <description>At Machu Picchu itself there are two options to eat something but both of these are located just outside the entrance of the site. The first is the Tinkuy Buffet Restaurant located next to the Sanctuary Lodge Hotel and the second is a small snack bar located on the right hand side of the entrance. Both are relatively pricey and officially it is forbidden to take food into the site itself.</description>
