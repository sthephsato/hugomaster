      <description>Drones are not allowed at Machu Picchu (officially at any of the Inca sites) under the law that protects the park from overflights of helicopters as well. Permits can be obtained for professional filming of Machu Picchu (very expensive and complicated but possible) but permits for drones are never given out. Earlier this year there was a visitor that filmed Machu Picchu with a drone and he was tracked down to appear in court.</description>
